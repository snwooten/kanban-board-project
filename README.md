# kanban-board-project
Using React to build a Kanban board

The Kanban Board project can transform from a basic task list into a robust project management tool to visualize workflows and optimize team collaboration. Build a project management tool with advanced functionalities like:

Swimlanes: Implement swimlanes for categorizing tasks based on priority, workflow stages, or team members.

Drag-and-drop functionality: Enable tasks to be easily dragged and dropped between different columns on the Kanban board.

Task dependencies: Allow users to define dependencies between tasks to visualize project workflows.

This project challenges you with complex UI component interactions for drag-and-drop and managing data structures for task dependencies.
